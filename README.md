# PacManProject-Berkley

## Description
The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

I tried to solve this problem by implementing different algorithms (DFS, BFS, A* etc.).
